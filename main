# --- Data Pre-processing ---

# 1. Convert binary categorical columns to 0 or 1 (for all problems)
binary_cols = ['mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'airconditioning', 'prefarea']
df[binary_cols] = df[binary_cols].apply(lambda x: x.map({'yes': 1, 'no': 0}))

# 2. Handle 'parking' (already numerical but ensure type consistency)
# 3. Handle 'furnishingstatus' (Problem 1.b does not use this, but good practice to handle all)
# Since the prompt only requires specific features, we will skip dummy variable creation for
# 'furnishingstatus' unless explicitly needed, to maintain feature sets consistency.

# Define output variable (price)
y_full = df['price'].values
